1. After considering correlation and conducting new filtering on the data as Andria suggested before, the prediction accuracy of the next day's bicycle rental data is improved a little, which is shown in Backups/BikeHire_Pred_Notebook_01.ipynb
2. In order to maintain the integrity of the overall structure, we are currently choose to train all five target features in a single model, which makes it impossible for us to optimize the model for different objectives, which I did not consider before. Next if time permits, I may consider training these target features separately and optimizing them as much as possible (which means we need to train and save 35 models, I think it might be a bit cumbersome and chaotic, but I have no other better idea). If you have any suggestions, please share them in the WhatsApp group. Thank you!
